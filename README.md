 `git-quick-stats` is a simple and efficient way to access various statistics in a git repository.

> Any git repository may contain tons of information about commits, contributors, and files. Extracting this information is not always trivial, mostly because there are a gadzillion options to a gadzillion git commands - I don't think there is a single person alive who knows them all. Probably not even [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds) himself :).
